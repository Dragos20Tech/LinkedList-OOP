# Linked List Summary

After building [TicTacToe](https://github.com/Dragos20Tech/TicTacToe-OOP) and [DiceGame](https://github.com/Dragos20Tech/DiceGame-OOP) using OOP and 
strengthening my skills and knowledge, I decided to move on to the next phase and start learning more about data structures and algorithms. With my 
instructor's help, I now understand how a linked list works and why it is essential to comprehend pointers and their inner workings. 

# Features
- Inserting a node in the linked list can be done at the head, middle, or end.
- Traversing the linked list by visually displaying it's data.
- Recursive node counting.
- Searching for a node in the linked list.
- Deleting a node in the linked list can be done by specifying the data you want to delete.

# Conclusion  
I learned that designing your own applications using OOP is not easy. You must have a good understanding of the principles of OOP and 
how objects interact with each other (relationship between objects : inheritance, aggregation, composition, etc.) in order to implement a great application.
Also, practicing a lot helps. After hours of trial and error, each day, you start seeing a pattern in solving most of your code problems 
and once you know the pattern you know how to solve the problem. If you read this, remember, PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT!
